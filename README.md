## What is Electrical Load Forecasting
We will start with a short explanation of what Load Forecasting is : 
-	Electrical load forecasting is the estimation of future load by an industry or a utility company. 
-	The estimation of both demand and requirements is crucial for an effective energy planning. 
-	Load forecasting are even used for determining the generation capacity, transmission and distribution systems etc.


## Overview
This is a Machine Learning model which aims to solve a Time-Series problem using FBprophet. The model takes input such as Temperature, Day and will print the output in the form of a table with a load chart which I created using Chart.js. The model is trained on `Energy Dataset.csv`
